1.	Using the Managing Multiple Servers using Ansible section from class 6 as your guide, you will create and manage infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.
2.	The following repos are used in this lab. Fork these into your own GitHub account
•	
o	Repo: ProvisionControlNode
o	Repo: ProvisionManagedNodes
o	Repo: ControlNodeFiles


 
 
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the slides for Class 6 to provision the Control Node

Managed nodes [including IP addresses for four web servers]
 







•	AWS EC2 list showing all created servers, including public IPs

 















Copying the SSH key from the Control Node output, use it to create an id_rsa.pub key in the ProvisionManagedNodes git repo. Modify your code to create 4 web servers. Create a hosts.ini file that has two groups, first two webservers as the [einstein] group, second batch of webservers as the [Cloud] group
 Rename install_httpd.yaml as install_Einstein.yaml, updating so that hosts is einstein. Execute this using the ansible-playbook command and screenshot the output. Capture screenshots of both web servers, as per slide 32 of Class 6 deck.
6. Create an install_Cloud.yaml to follow the same pattern, but deploying the York U Cloud computing page, the link for which is https://github.com/wessamabdelwahab/CSCC1030.
7. Execute install_Cloud.yaml using the ansible-playbook command and screenshot the output. Capture screenshots of both web servers, as per slide 32 of Class 6 deck.
